# Kagakudex

Inspired by *'Pok√©Dex'*, this is the nerdy version of it, the 'Kagaku-dex'. Kagaku is the Japanese word for 'chemistry', and Kagaku-dex is a web app that provides info on the elements of the periodic table.
Hope it helps and gives some insight into accessing and displaying JSON data!

~Although the project is finished, it has not been deployed yet (pretty unnecessary).~ The project is ready to use publicly, and here is the website URL: https://kagakudex.vercel.app/.

If you would like to play around with it yourself, clone this repository on your local disk and run the `index.html`.
Here's the command: `git clone https://github.com/Advaith7Joshi/Kagakudex.git`

Happy Hacking! :)
